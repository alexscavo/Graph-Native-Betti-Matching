# Continuous vessel graph experiments

Latest investigation: [local CNN information for geometry](local-geometry-diagnostic.md), submitted 871744_0/1/2 with a SyntheticMRI curvature audit and IXI caveat, following the [completed full validation comparison](full-validation-comparison.md) with tables and an offline gallery.

**Current learning run:** GT extraction completed; training and all 13,071 eligible test patches are complete; test logging was recovered and uploaded to W&B. Start with [the current training report](spline-10k-training.md). The interactive pages below are reference prototypes.

For the real-image follow-up, see [the IXI patch experiment](ixi_patch.md), with MRI context, uncertain centerline guides, mask support, and a portable 3D viewer.

For the matching SyntheticMRI viewer, starting with the **10-control B-spline**, see [the SyntheticMRI patch experiment](synthetic_mri_patch.md).

## Question

Can a graph with only junction and termination nodes preserve tortuous vessel geometry by storing a continuous curve on each edge? This is a **representation oracle** experiment: topology, endpoints, and dense reference centerlines are supplied. It does not test whether a model can predict them from an image.

The synthetic graph is a small bifurcating tree with two junctions, four terminations, and five branches. Each reference branch interpolates seven sparse waypoints with a smooth Catmull-Rom curve. The waypoints add broad arcs and an S-bend to the right branch; the tortuosity slider scales their transverse and depth offsets. The 2D page shows soft tubular vessel strokes; the 3D page shows a projection of simple spatial centerlines. Neither is a realistic medical image or a voxel simulation.

## Curve families

| Family | Free geometry values per edge in dimension `d` | Main limitation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Single cubic Bézier | `2d` | Cannot express several independent bends |
| Clamped cubic B-spline with `n` controls | `(n - 2)d` | Needs more controls as detail increases |
| Piecewise cubic Bézier with `s` segments | `(3s - 1)d` | This baseline is only position continuous at segment joins |

All curves fix their endpoints to the corresponding graph nodes. Pink internal controls and piecewise segment joins are edge parameters, not graph vertices. Drag a pink point to edit the selected edge; in 3D, Shift-drag moves it in depth. **Refit selected edge** restores its least-squares fit. Fits minimize squared distances between reference samples and curve samples at the same parameter value. The piecewise baseline obtains its internal joins from reference samples, while counting them in its parameter cost. This experiment uses known topology and centerlines, so it says nothing yet about learnability from an image.

The displayed mean symmetric curve distance averages each sampled point's closest distance to the other sampled polyline in both directions. It is shown in reference pixels at the initial viewport scale; the 3D calculation uses the original 3D coordinates and does not depend on camera rotation or zoom. Tortuosity is centerline length divided by endpoint chord length. The object-token count remains six for every setting.

## Suggested first checks

1. At low tortuosity, compare all families with their smallest parameter count.
2. Raise tortuosity on the right tortuous branch. Check whether one cubic misses the S-bend and whether additional spline controls recover it.
3. Compare error against geometry values per edge; look for a useful elbow rather than demanding zero error.
4. In 3D, rotate the same fit to inspect depth error that is hidden in one projection.

The source rationale is in [vascular_graph_representation.md](../../Graph-Native-Betti-Matching/docs/research/vascular_graph_representation.md), especially the function-valued edge section. The [research roadmap](../../Graph-Native-Betti-Matching/docs/research/vascular_graph_roadmap.md) places this as exploratory Phase 13 after the adaptive-node work. Those source documents remain in their project's canonical research directory; documentation specific to this experiment lives here.

The source-health inventory in `archive/` describes the old, disappearing source; use the restored dataset's `restore-verification.json` for current availability. Earlier 2D/3D and IXI examples remain reference experiments for the representation design.
